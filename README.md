### Summary of Enhancements

- **Full Screen & Immersive UI:**  
  • The cube view now fills the screen with a pleasing background gradient.  
  • A title is displayed at the top using modern typography.

- **Camera Setup:**  
  • The camera is placed at (7,7,7) with a look-at constraint, providing a 45° angled view that nicely displays the 3D cube.

- **Custom Buttons & Control Panel:**  
  • Buttons are styled with a semi‐transparent dark background, rounded corners, and subtle shadows for a modern feel.  
  • They are arranged in neat rows and are large enough for comfortable iPhone touch interactions.

- **Smooth Animations:**  
  • The cube’s moves are animated with SceneKit actions, and antialiasing is enabled for a crisp appearance.

Compile and run the app on an iPhone or iOS 18 simulator. You’ll see the cube in a full-screen, immersive view with an attractive control panel. Users can interact by rotating the cube via touch or by tapping the custom move, scramble, and solve buttons. Enjoy your modern, refreshing Rubik’s Cube simulation!
